        A recent viral meme featuring me(Hanzala Afridi) and Respected Sir Sher Afzal Marwat Sahab üòÖ has been a
            delightful whirlwind! Witnessing it's reach has ignited a spark ‚Äì a chance to leverage the "Software Warr
            Gya" platform for a truly impactful purpose. üöÄ

            <br>
            <br>

            Yes, Sher Afzal Marwat is known for coining the phrase "software warr gaya," which became popular on social
            media and in public discourse. He used this phrase during an interview to imply that someone had changed
            their stance or behavior, often suggesting that external pressure or influence caused the change. The term
            "software" metaphorically refers to a person's mindset or programming, and "warr gaya" means that it has
            malfunctioned or been altered.

            <br>
            <br>

            This phrase quickly caught on and became a meme, widely used to describe situations where people seem to
            suddenly shift their opinions or actions, particularly in a way that suggests they were influenced or
            manipulated. The phrase reflects Marwat's ability to create catchy, impactful expressions that resonate with
            the public, contributing further to his fame.

            <br>
            <br>

            And at last, My motive of creating this platform is about our Respected Sir Sher Afzal Marwat, to aware the
            public about his "Software Warr Gaya" phrase üòÖ
